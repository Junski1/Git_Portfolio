# CanvasScripts

Here are scripts to easily control canvas and its panels in Unity in the same scene.

Usage:

CanvasManager is its own object.
Every panel has a CanvasObject script -> name and type

types:
base (game hud for example),
overlay (on top of base, pause menu for example),
modal(on top of everything)

There are also some button scripts to switch panels.

CanvasManager has functions to select which of the panels start Enabled and Disabled.
